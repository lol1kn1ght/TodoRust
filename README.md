# TodoRust

## The goal

This is my first pet-project on Rust, and the primary objective is to learn and gain proficiency in the Rust programming
language. Through this project, I aim to explore the various features, concepts, and techniques that Rust offers.

As a beginner in Rust, I will be using this project as a platform to understand the core principles of the language,
such as its strong static typing, memory safety guarantees, and efficient concurrency model. By implementing different
functionalities and experimenting with Rust's syntax and idioms, I hope to deepen my understanding and improve my skills
in writing idiomatic Rust code.

While the project itself may be relatively simple, its significance lies in the learning process and the hands-on
experience it provides. I will be leveraging online resources, official documentation, and the Rust community's support
to tackle challenges and expand my knowledge.

I am excited to embark on this journey of learning Rust and discover the unique features and strengths of this modern
programming language. With each step forward in this pet-project, I anticipate growing as a Rust developer and gaining
confidence in utilizing Rust for future projects.
